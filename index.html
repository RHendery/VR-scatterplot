  This creates a 3D virtual reality scatterplot from a csv data file with three numeric coordinate columns (x, y, z) and one or two further text variable columns for colouring the points. The scatterplot can be viewed in a VR headset such as the cardboard. It is simply a webpage that the user can point the mobile phone browser to. (click screen after it loads to get fullscreen mode).
  
  The scatterplot code was originally based on Phil Pedruco's 3D scatterplot at http://bl.ocks.org/phil-pedruco/9852362 but has been heavily modified since.

It contains a callback function which calls "scatter data", a function in the "scatterData.js" file. That has to be called from in the dataRead callback, otherwise it could try to complete before the file has been (asynchronously) read.
